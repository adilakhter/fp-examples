# FP Examples

A code repository to try out different code snippets using Scala and Functional Programming.

In order to get started, we use the repository for exercises for Advanced Functional Programming in
Scala (a LambdaConf workshop taught by @jdegoes).

# Getting Started

Launch SBT and enter incremental compilation mode:

```
$ sbt
 > ~ compile
```

SBT should download all dependencies and compile the source code.

Then open up the `src/main/scala/` directory to see the code snippets.

To run specific code example, invoke `run` command.
